In 2001, he was named the NFL Defensive Player of the Year, and the same year saw him set a record for the highest number of sacks in one season. After 15 years with the Giants, Michael retired from football on 9 June 2008, and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2014.</p><p>As soon as he retired, Michael joined the football show “Fox NFL Sunday” as a co-host, and then served as a fill-in host for the show “Live! with Regis and Kelly”.
