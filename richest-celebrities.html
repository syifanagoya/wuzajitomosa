id=what-brad-pitt8217s-net-worth><strong>What is Brad Pitt's net worth and salary?</strong></h2><p>Brad Pitt is an award-winning actor and producer who has net worth of $400 million. Brad Pitt is one of the most-famous, and highest-paid entertainers in the world. He consistently earns a minimum of $20 million for major motion picture releases. He earned a career-high $30 million upfront salary for an upcoming Apple TV movie about Formula One.</p><p>Pitt has been nominated for several Academy Awards. In 2014 he won an Academy Award as a Producer when "12 Years a Slave" took home the Best Picture award. In 2020 he won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role in "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood."</p><p>Perhaps more importantly to his bottom line net worth, Brad Pitt is the co-founder of Plan B Entertainment. He co-founded the production company with his then-wife, Jennifer Aniston, in the 1990s. He bought her out in the wake of their divorce. Over the years Plan B has produced a number of important films including "The Departed," "Moonlight" and "12 Years a Slave," all of which won the Best Picture Academy Award. Many of Brad's own movies have been produced by Plan B, for example "Troy," "Moneyball," "The Assassination of <a href=# title="Jesse James Net Worth">Jesse James</a> by the Coward Robert Ford," "Killing Them Softly," "World War Z," "The Big Short" and "Ad Astra." More info on Plan B later in this article.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>William Bradley Pitt was born on December 18, 1963 in Shawnee, Oklahoma. Brad and his two younger siblings were raised in Springfield Missouri. He attended the University of Missouri where he majored in journalism with a focus on advertising. At some point in college he caught the acting bug and had the idea to move to Los Angeles. He up and left school just two weeks short of completing his degree and moved to California.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-263915 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/brad.jpg alt width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-263915 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=success><strong>Success</strong></h2><p>His first film role was a background part in a film called "Hunk." Brad can also be seen for a brief moment in the background of the 1987 <a href=# title="Kevin Costner Net Worth">Kevin Costner</a> movie "No Way Out."</p><p>After various guest appearances and minor roles, Pitt gained notoriety for his supporting role in "Thelma and Louise." In 1992 he co-starred in the Academy-Award winning film "A River Runs Through It." Pitt received tremendous praise for his performance in the highly successful 1995 crime drama "Seven," which grossed $327 million worldwide. Pitt received a Golden Globe award as well as an Academy Award nomination for his next film, "12 Monkeys."</p><p>Pitt's dedication to his roles has taken him up the Alps, in the boxing ring, and in the depths of startlingly accurate accents. Other noteworthy Brad Pitt films include:</p><ul><li>Ocean's Eleven</li><li>Troy</li><li>Babel</li><li>Mr. and Mrs. Smith</li><li>Fight Club</li><li>World War Z</li><li>Moneyball</li><li>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</li><li>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</li><li>Bullet Train</li><li>Babylon</li></ul><p>He's also set to star in and produce a Formula One racing film directed by Joseph Kosinski for Apple TV. He earned a $30 million fee for this project, a career high without including royalties.</p><h2 id=plan-b><strong>Plan B</strong></h2><p>In November 2001, Brad Pitt co-found Plan B Entertainment with his wife at the time, <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a>, super producer <a href=#>Brad Grey</a> and several other executives. Brad bought Jennifer out of the company in the wake of their divorce for an undisclosed amount. In October 2022, it was revealed that Plan B was in the process of selling a 60% stake to French media conglomerate Mediawan. The deal reportedly valued Plan B at $300 million and was paid for with 50% cash and 50% stock in Mediawan. In other words, at the time of the transaction Mediawan paid $180 million, comprised of $90 million in stock and $90 million in cash, to own 60% of Plan B. Assuming Brad previously owned 60% of the company, he either took the full amount for himself and no longer owns any of Plan B, or (more likely) he sold roughly half of his personal shares and shared the windfall with his partners.</p><p>As of this writing, Plan B movies have generated $3 billion in global box office revenue on $1 billion in total production budgets. Plan B's most successful movie in terms of worldwide box office revenue is "World War Z" which earned $530 million globally. Its second highest performing movie is "Troy" which earned $483 million.</p><p>Notable Plan B movies include:</p><ul><li>Troy</li><li>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</li><li>The Departed</li><li>The Time Traveler's Wife</li><li>Eat Pray Love, Moneyball</li><li>World War Z</li><li>Kick-Ass</li><li>12 Years a Slave</li><li>Ad Astra</li></ul><h2 id=notable-salaries><strong>Notable Salaries</strong></h2><p>In 1991 Brad earned just $6,000 for his bit part in Thelma & Louise. Just two years later he earned $500,000 for Kalifornia. That's the same as just under $1 million after adjusting for inflation. Two years after Kalifornia, he earned a cool $4 million for Seven. The following year he earned his first $10 million paycheck for Sleepers. He earned another $10 million for Seven Years in Tibet.</p><p>By the late 1990s, his base film salary had increased to $17.5 million, which he earned for Meet Joe Black, Fight Club, Spy Game and Troy. He earned $20 million for Mr. & Mrs. Smith and has earned $20 million for most starring roles that he is not producer. He cut his salary in half to $10 million to appear in the Tarantino movies Inglorious Basterds and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.</p><p>In 2001 Brad accepted a lower base salary of $10 million in exchange for a percentage of backend receipts when he co-starred in Ocean's Eleven. When it was all said and done, he ended up earning $30 million from the film.</p><p>For his role in the upcoming Formula One drama, Pitt is reportedly earning a $30 million payday.</p><p>As a film producer, Pitt has earned untold additional millions. Perhaps more than what he has earned during his career as an actor.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-152450 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Brad-Pitt.jpg alt="Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images" width=900 height=591 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-152450 class=wp-caption-text>Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images</p><h2 id=biggest-box-office-successes><strong>Biggest Box Office Successes</strong></h2><p>Here are Brad Pitt's 10 biggest box office successes:</p><li><li>World War Z (2013) â€“ $540 million</li><li>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019) â€“ $374.3 million</li><li>Troy (2004) â€“ $497.4 million</li><li>Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) â€“ $478.2 million</li><li>Ocean's Eleven (2001) â€“ $450.7 million</li><li>Ocean's Twelve (2004) â€“ $363.4 million</li><li>Seven (1995) â€“ $327 million</li><li>Megamind (2010) â€“ $321.9 million (voice role)</li><li>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) â€“ $333.9 million</li><li>Inglourious Basterds (2009) â€“ $321.5 million</li></li><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>As we mentioned previously, Brad was previously married to actress Jennifer Aniston. They married in 2000 and divorced in 2005. There have always been rumors that they broke up after he began an affair with his Mr. and Mrs. Smith co-star <a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a>. After being in a relationship for nearly a decade Brad and Angelina married in 2014. They divorced in 2019 but officially separated in 2016, however their custody and support battle raged on for many more years.</p><p>Pitt and Jolie have six children, a mix of adopted and conceived. After Jolie gave birth to their daughter Shiloh, the couple sold the North American photo rights to People Magazine for $4.1 million and the British rights to Hello! for $3.5 million, for a total payday of $7.6 million. After giving birth to their twins Knox and Vivienne, they again sold the rights to People and Hello! for a total of $15 million. That still stands as the record for <a href=#>most-expensive celebrity photograph of all time</a>.</p><p>In 2022, Pitt began dating jewelry designer Ines de Ramon.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-262733 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/brad.jpg alt width=594 height=438 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-262733 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=philanthropy><strong>Philanthropy</strong></h2><p>Pitt has been actively involved with a number of humanitarian causes throughout his career. He has donated generously to the ONE Campaign, Make It Right Foundation, and global humanitarian aid fund, Jolie-Pitt Foundation, which he co-founded with partner Angelina Jolie. In 2010, Pitt and Jolie donated $1 million to Doctors Without Borders in the wake of Haiti earthquake. Through the Jolie-Pitt Foundation the couple donated tens of millions of dollars to charity. Through the Make It Right Foundation he built 150 affordable homes in New Orleans' Ninth Ward in the response to Hurricane Katrina.</p><h2 id=los-feliz-estate><strong>Los Feliz Estate</strong></h2><p>Brad owns an impressive portfolio of real estate that includes properties around the world that are valued at over $100 million cumulatively.</p><p>From 1994 to 2023, Brad's Pitt's primary home-base in LA was compound that he pieced together over the years through multiple transactions. Brad reportedly sold this mansion in March 2023 for $39 million after quietly shopping it around a few weeks prior. It never was officially listed on the MLS.</p><p>Located in LA's Los Feliz neighborhood, today the property is actually made up of 5 contiguous parcels that span just under two acres. The property has four homes including a 6,600 square-foot main house, a skateboard park, swimming pool and more. Brad bought his first parcel in the compound in 1994 for $1.7 million. The seller was the actress <a href=#>Cassandra Peterson</a>, who famously portrays the "Elvira" character. Cassandra was convinced the house was haunted. Cassandra said of the home:</p><p>"<strong>Something weird was going on. Footsteps above my head on the ceiling. Clouds of smoke forming into what looked like a human and then disappearing. A black shadow floating on the bottom of the pool that wouldn't go away. After a priest performed an exorcism in the home and a Native American cleansed the home with sage, it seemed to all go away.</strong>"</p><p>The primary home has 6 bedrooms and 7 bathrooms spread over 7,000 square feet of living space. Here's how the estate looked in 1997 after he had purchased several nearby estates but before he had combined them into a contiguous single property:</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-343041 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/brad-pitt-los-feliz-estate.jpg alt width=900 height=654 sizes="(max-width: 1641px) 100vw, 1641px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-343041 class=wp-caption-text>Brad Pitt's Los Feliz Estate in 1997, via Getty Images</p><h2 id=other-real-estate><strong>Other Real Estate</strong></h2><p>During his marriage to Jennifer Aniston, the former couple lived in an 11,000 square foot Wallace Neff-designed mansion in Beverly Hills. They bought this property in 2001 for $12.5 million, one year after marrying. They proceeded to perform a complete renovation that took three years. After breaking up and finalizing their divorce, Brad and Jennifer sold the home for $28 million. In March 2020 <a href=#>this home sold for $44.5 millio</a>n. Here is a video tour of the former Pitt/Aniston Beverly Hills mansion:</p><p></p><p>In 2000 Brad paid $4 million for a beach house set on 15 acres, north of Santa Barbara in the town of Goleta, California</p><p>In late 2006, around the time he was planning the construction of 150 of affordable homes in New Orleans, Pitt spent $3.5 million on a historic mansion in the city's famous French Quarter. Pitt and Jolie listed the home for sale in 2015 for $6.5 million but ultimately took the property off the market after not finding a buyer.</p><p>In 2004 Brad paid $8.4 million for a bluff-top mansion in Malibu, California. He sold this home in December 2011 to <a href=# title="Ellen DeGeneres Net Worth">Ellen DeGeneres</a> and <a href=# title="Portia de Rossi Net Worth">Portia de Rossi</a> for $12 million. Just six months later, Ellen and Portia sold it to a new buyer for $13 million. In October 2022 this buyer sold the home for $45 million to a married pair of fashion entrepreneurs with close ties to <a href=# title="Kim Kardashian Net Worth">Kim Kardashian</a>.</p><p>In 2015, Brad bought a villa on the Spanish island of Majorca for $3.7 million.</p><p>In July 2022 Brad paid $40 million for an architecturally significant historic home in Carmel Highlands, California.</p><p>In April 2023, Pitt bought the Los Feliz home owned by Getty oil heiress, Aileen Getty, for $5.5 million.</p><h2 id=chateau-miraval><strong>Chateau Miraval</strong></h2><p>In 2008, <a href=#>Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie spent a mouth-water $67 million</a> on a 1,200-acre winery in the south of France called Chateau Miraval. Chateau Miraval is one of the top producers of rosÃ©, with its bottles available at most high end grocery stores in the US.</p><p>The main house on the property reportedly has 35 rooms, several guest houses and a recording studio. They actually married at the chateau in 2014. This property became a major point of contention during their divorce proceedings and reportedly <a href=#>caused the final settlement to drag on for years</a>. They did eventually reach a settlement that likely involved an agreement that they would either sell the property down the road or allow their children to be the primary heirs.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-188827 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/miraval.jpg alt width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-188827 class=wp-caption-text>MICHEL GANGNE/AFP/Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZK%2BzrcNmp6KspGK7psCMsKarrJhk</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jeanne-arnold-who-is-ed-ames-wife.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jeanne Arnold: Who is Ed Ames wife?</a>
