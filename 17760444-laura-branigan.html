Even oldies like the Carpenters and Lulu managed to pull off top 20 hits in the early 80s. Only Sheena Easton managed to span the entire 80s of female singers and then she was gone by the early 90s.</p><p>Laura's big early hits were reworks by Diane Warren and others of European songs, which they wrote English lyrics too, like Ti Amo and Solitare.</p><p>Laura also had a #11 hit with How Am I Supposed to Live Without You, which writer Michael Bolton took to #1 for himself later on as well as had a top 40 hit with "The Power of Love" which Celine took to #1 in the 90s.
