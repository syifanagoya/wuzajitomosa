It subsequently recorded the EP "Four Songs," which launched the single "Operation Spirit (The Tyranny of Tradition)." Live's debut album, "Mental Jewelry," came out a few months later. Written by Kowalczyk, some of the album's lyrics were inspired by the Indian philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti.</p><h2 id=mainstream-success-with-live><strong>Mainstream Success with Live</strong></h2><p>Live began achieving mainstream recognition in the mid-90s thanks to its appearances on the MTV 120 Minutes tour, <a href=# title="Peter Gabriel Net Worth">Peter Gabriel</a>'s WOMAD tour, and at Woodstock '94.
