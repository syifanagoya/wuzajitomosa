We became spinsters or old maids; nothing better than those stereotypes, nothing in between. Thanks to women like Aniston, and so many others in her company, <a href=# rel=noopener>being a single woman has a completely different connotation</a> now. Women are embracing their lives independently from relationships, proving that women can and are completely fulfilled without a mate.</p><p>It’s empowering to see women like Aniston, Stevie Nicks, Tracee Ellis Ross, and more <a href=# rel=noopener>use their platforms to flip the script</a>. Women are so much more than the committed romantic relationships we have, and it’s about time the rest of the world saw us that way. We’re offering up kudos to some of our favorite single ladies in the industry, who’ve shown us time and again that fulfillment doesn’t come with who you spend your life with, but how you spend your life.
